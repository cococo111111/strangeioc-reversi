//Every context starts by attaching a ContextView to a GameObject.
//The main job of this ContextView is to instantiate the Context.
//Remember, if the GameObject is destroyed, the Context and all your
//bindings go with it.

//This ContextView has two jobs:
//1. Provide the Cross-Context dependencies (see MainContext)
//2. Load the other Contexts (see MainStartupCommand)
